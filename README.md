# OpenVPN Installation on AWS EC2 with HTTPS ALB using Terraform

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up OpenVPN on an AWS EC2 instance, along with an HTTPS Application Load Balancer (ALB) and SSL certificate using Terraform. This setup provides a secure way to access your VPN server from anywhere.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials

## Architecture Overview

The following components will be provisioned in this setup:

- EC2 instance for OpenVPN
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) with HTTPS listener
- SSL/TLS certificate for secure communication

## Getting Started

To get started with OpenVPN on AWS EC2 using Terraform, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

### Step 2: Update Variables

Open the `terraform.tfvars` file and update the variables as per your requirements. Provide the desired values for variables such as `aws_region`, `aws_access_key`, `aws_secret_key`, `ec2_key_name`, etc. Adjust any other variables if needed.

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform

Initialize Terraform in the repository directory by running the following command:
terraform init

### Step 4: Plan and Apply

Review the planned infrastructure changes before applying them. Run the following command:
terraform plan

If the plan looks good, apply the changes:
terraform apply

Terraform will create the necessary AWS resources, including the EC2 instance, security groups, ALB, SSL certificate, and associated resources.

### Step 5: Access OpenVPN

Once the Terraform apply is successful, you can access OpenVPN by opening the ALB DNS name provided in the Terraform output. The URL should be in the format `https://<alb-dns-name>`. Allow a few minutes for the ALB to be fully provisioned before accessing OpenVPN.

### Step 6: OpenVPN Configuration

Follow the OpenVPN documentation to configure the necessary VPN settings, user access, and security options for your use case.

## Clean Up

To clean up and destroy the provisioned resources when you're done, run the following command:
terraform destroy

Confirm the destruction by typing "yes" when prompted.

## Conclusion

You have successfully deployed OpenVPN on an AWS EC2 instance, configured with an HTTPS ALB and SSL certificate using Terraform. Enjoy using OpenVPN to securely access your VPN server from anywhere!

Please note that this is a general guide, and you may need to adapt it to your specific requirements. Refer to the Terraform documentation and AWS documentation for further details and customization options.
